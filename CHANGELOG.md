# Changelog

Every change to what Kanso installs, newest first. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): a release that lists Breaking or
Removed changes is a major version, one that lists Added or Deprecated is a
minor version, anything else is a patch. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). `npm run check:version`
checks all of this, and merging to main releases the version in
`kanso/mods/kanso-chrome/version.json`, which is what the updater offers.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- PR panel: the list's new Closed tab shows the repository's 30 most recently merged or closed pull requests. Like the open ones, they are grouped as this branch, yours, and your colleagues'. A finished pull request shows only when you pick it (#27).

### Fixed

- PR panel: a branch's merged or closed pull request no longer opens as the branch's own. The newest open one stands in, or the panel offers to create one (#27).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Kanso updates itself, apart from Herdr. When there is a newer release, an "Update Kanso to X" row appears above Settings, with one toast per version. Installing it checks every mod first, keeps the keys you changed, and keeps your previous layout as `layouts/kanso.json.old-<time>` (#26).
- `kanso.panels` in `shared.json`: other mods can add their own side panels to the tab bar (#25, by Iván Campaña).

### Fixed

- Specs and Insights show in the tab bar only when their mods are really installed (#24, by Iván Campaña).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-03

The first release. It holds everything from the first commit (31 October 2026) to the v1.0.0 tag.

### Added

- Kanso: a quiet Herdr layout with side panels that open on demand (Files, Changes), light and dark themes (`kanso-day`, `kanso`), and a recipe to rebuild it (5db1c86).
- An endless horizontal strip of panes with a minimap, keyboard navigation, and a view that glides to the focused pane (b245258, 77215ff, c4b12fd, 437c17a).
- Choose how many panes fit in the view, from 1 to 8, and resize them on the dividers (6c9fe03).
- A grip that moves a pane before or after another (736918f).
- A terminal menu that knows about the strip (2eccd5f).
- Open with: open a pane's folder in a code editor (#1).
- PR panel: the branch's pull request, managed from Kanso (#2).
- Focus memory, pinned panes, and a sidebar that lists and reorders every session (#3).
- Drop a pane to stack it. Stacked panes are linked in the sidebar, and a preview shows where a held pane will land (#6).
- Preview a file in the side panel from Open with, without an editor (#9).
- Order the sidebar's sessions: pinned first, then by last update, attention, kind, screen order, or your own order (#10).
- PR panel: lists every open pull request in the repository, with a quiet state outside a repository (#12).
- PR panel: one pull request at a time, with the open ones in a dropdown (#16).
- Strip: a swipe over an edge tab slides the view too (#17).
- PR panel: the description and a copy-link button (#21).
- Strip: the selected pane has a fine accent border (#22).

### Changed

- Side panels share the work area's background, and a panel that closes itself unmounts (0ee86f2).
- A quieter minimap and simpler canvas keys (1aa9a72, 9516587).
- Split down stacks the new pane in its column. There are no vertical moves (aecfaa6).
- Whole panes only: tabs at the edges replace the peeks of the continuous canvas (8d837d5, #4).
- An edge rail, resizing on Herdr's own dividers, and gutters instead of lines (#5).
- Kanso leans on the SDK: one panel mod, the header inside the strip, and fewer redraws (#7).
- A README about what Kanso does for you, tests grouped by feature, and a reusable benchmark (#14).
- New screenshots and previews that lead with the strip, the PR handoff, and Open with (cb6540c, 4e16fba, #15, #23).
- README: install optional mods while another layout is shown (#20).

### Fixed

- Drags survive peeks and fillers, and the resize grip is visible (5585ee2).
- The edge rail and dragging in the sidebar (#8).
- Layout writes no longer drop each other, and work that still ran hot was cut (#11).
- Layout writers never save another layout's tree into `kanso.json` (#18, by Iván Campaña).
- The side panel resizes again (#21).
