# Kanso

Your agents in a row, not a grid. Kanso puts terminals on a horizontal strip:
a new agent opens beside the one you're in, at its own width, and the view
slides to it. Nothing gets squeezed, so you can read what each one is doing.
Next to them: your repos and worktrees, the diff, the pull request with its CI
and open threads, an agent started on a PR's feedback in one click, and one key
(Cmd+Shift+O) to open the folder in Cursor, VS Code, Zed or Neovim, over SSH
too. Warm stone greys in light and dark; color only when an agent's state
matters. The name is the Japanese principle of simplicity, removing what is not
needed.

## What you see

Left to right, then top to bottom. Sizes are px at zoom 1.

- **Sidebar**, theme `chrome` (`#161615` dark, `#e3dfd6` light).
  - **Top strip**, 48 tall: the macOS traffic lights (at `[12, 16]`) and,
    at its right end (14 in), Herdr's mark: its icon
    (`frame/welcome/herdr.png`, 20, radius 6) and "Herdr" (13, semibold,
    `foreground`), so you know what you're in. It drags the window.
    Collapsed, the strip is empty and the mark sits lower, over the rail's
    buttons.
  - **Spaces** (`kanso-spaces`), filling the middle.
    - Open (256 wide): a 40-tall row with a + (New space) at the left, and
      Search and Hide sidebar at the right. Each is a 32 square with a 17 icon
      in `muted` that turns `foreground` on hover over a `foreground`+`12`
      wash.
    - Space rows are 32 tall with radius 6. Each starts with a 22 avatar
      (radius 6): the name's first letter, semibold 12, in the space's color
      over that color at alpha `26`. Then come the name (13, medium when
      active) and, right-aligned, the repo, branch and ahead/behind counts in
      11.5.
    - The active space has a `foreground`+`14` wash; hover shows
      `foreground`+`0c`.
    - Worktree spaces nest under their repo on 1px `input` guide lines.
    - A space's agents are listed under it in 28-tall rows: program icon 15,
      title 12.5, status mark at the right. The focused agent is in full ink
      over a `foreground`+`0c` wash; the others are `muted`, and idle ones
      `dim`.
    - Collapsed (76 wide): only the + and Hide buttons, stacked, then one
      centred 32 square per space holding its avatar. A 7 dot sits at its
      top-right corner when the space is blocked or done. The name shows in
      a tooltip.
  - **Footer** (`kanso-chrome`, `footer: true`), 156 tall, bottom-aligned:
    - Settings (gear) and Add machine (server icon), 34 tall, icon 17.
    - An 8 space.
    - An account chip: a 32 avatar (28 when collapsed) with the home folder
      name's first letter, then the name and "N agents".
    - Collapsed, each item is a centred square with its label as a tooltip.
      When an app update is ready, a 6 `accent` dot shows on Settings.
    - Kanso's own release, apart from Herdr's (`update.js`): when a newer
      `vX.Y.Z` tag than `version.json` exists, an "Update Kanso to X" row
      (refresh icon, 6 `accent` dot) sits above Settings and the footer
      grows to 192 while it shows (back to 156 after; a size you set is kept).
      Tags are read with `git ls-remote` on start and every 5 minutes (and on
      `kanso-chrome.check`, which also toasts "Kanso is up to date"); one toast per version,
      whose click runs `kanso-chrome.update`. Updating downloads the tag into
      `.kanso-update/`, refuses it unless its `version.json` matches, runs
      `herdr-app check` on each mod, merges `keys.json` three-way against the
      installed release's (your own keys stay), replaces the layout only if
      the release changed it (the old one kept as `kanso.json.old-<time>`),
      copies the themes, then swaps each mod folder whole. The fresh copy
      toasts "Kanso updated to X".
- **Corners**: two radii and nothing else. Surfaces (panes, cards, popovers,
  menus) are 8; controls and rows (buttons, tabs, list rows, tiles, chips,
  fields) are 6; dots are circles.
- **Work area**, padding 6, gap 4, on `chrome`. No card and no lines: the
  panes are `background` slabs with radius 8 on the frame, 6 apart, and
  that 6 gutter is where Herdr's own dividers are dragged.
    - **Tab bar** (`kanso-tabs`), 48 tall, no line under it. It drags the
      window.
      - Tabs are 26 tall with radius 6: program icon 15, name 12.5, then the
        tab's status. The active tab has a `foreground`+`12` wash and the
        rest are `muted`, with no borders and no tray behind them. A close x
        (13) shows on the active tab only when there is more than one tab.
      - After the tabs, a + (16 icon, 28 square) opens the shipped
        `new-menu`.
      - At the right are the panel buttons: Files, Spend, Changes, PR and
        Shipped (trophy icon), as icons only (15, in a 26 square ghost
        button) with the name as a tooltip, and a wash when their panel is
        open. Pressing one and letting go on another moves it there.
        Right-click opens the Panels popup (`kanso-tabs` again, as an
        overlay with `props().arrange`): one 30 tall row per panel with a
        grip, its icon, its name and a switch, dragged the same way into
        order. The order is in shared `kanso.panels.order` and the panels
        turned off in `kanso.panels.off`; a panel turned off while open
        closes. Custom panels from `kanso.panels` join the list.
    - **Panes**: an endless canvas (`kanso-strip`). Panes sit side by side
      in columns. You choose how many fit in the view at once, 1 to 8
      (default 2): a new column takes 1/n of it, so on a wide screen you can
      hold 3, 4 or more side by side. A lone pane fills the view. Every header ends in a
      six-dot grip (14 icon, `dim`, `foreground` on hover or while held,
      grab cursor), 6 from the edge. The header's top corners round with
      the slab's (8). Resizing is Herdr's own: drag the 6
      gutter between two columns sideways, or between two stacked panes up
      and down (a column never goes under 140 px, a stacked pane under 90).
      Once the drag has rested 250 ms, the strip reads the sizes back from
      the layout and its ruler blocks (one under each terminal, 8 tall,
      for its width, which also draws the slab's rounded bottom since a
      terminal paints square corners; one 1px wide at the start of work-body
      for the height) and keeps them as
      shares, so later trees keep what you dragged. The view always starts at a
      column's edge and shows only whole, live panes: as many as fit, which
      then share the width by their weights. It never slides past the first
      start from which the rest of the row fits. When columns lie beyond an
      edge, a 28-wide edge rail stands there (the right one after the side
      panel while one is open) in `chrome` (`hover` on hover),
      so it reads as frame, not pane. At its middle, a ‹ or › (14, `muted`)
      over a stack of 20 tiles (`input`, rounded 6, 5 apart, up to 8 then
      "+N"), one per pane beyond in row order, each with its program icon
      (12, `muted` when tinted) and, at its top-right corner, its state (a 7
      dot: breathing `working`, breathing `blocked`, `done`; none when the
      program reports nothing). Resting the pointer on the stack (350 ms)
      opens a card beside it (220 wide, `chrome`, a soft shadow, rounded
      9): "N panes beyond the left edge" (11, `dim`) and a 26-tall row per
      pane with its icon, its name (12.5) and its state dot. A click on a
      tile or a row brings that pane in; a click on the bare rail brings in
      the nearest one.
      Off-screen columns aren't drawn. A split down stacks a pane
      under the focused one in the same column; stacked panes share the
      column's height equally until you drag the gutter between them
      (evening out resets that). Panes never move vertically: dragging one out
      of a stack makes it its own column. A tab holding a mod pane falls back to
      Herdr's own split view.
      A column can be pinned (the header's pin button on hover, "Pin pane"
      in the right-click menu, Cmd+Alt+P). It stays on the side of the view
      it was on, always whole and at its width, and never changes place:
      dragging it, moving it, dropping a pane on it and new panes leave it
      where it is. The rest slides in what the pinned columns leave (never
      under 20% of the view; a pin that would leave less is refused). A
      pinned header has the `accent` at 14% (25% when selected) and a 12 px
      pin by the title; it has no grip.
      Each pane has a 34-tall header (a `{pane}` copy of `kanso-strip`,
      always shown). The
      selected pane's header has the `selected` background (in the strip, the
      pane the strip remembers, so it stays marked while a side panel has the
      keyboard). With more than one pane in the tab, that pane also wears a
      1px border in `accent` at 55%, following its rounded corners; the
      others carry the same border in clear, so a new selection shifts no
      terminal, and none shows while a pane is held. A pane whose agent needs you has `blocked` at 40% instead,
      a 2px `blocked` bar along the header's bottom breathing between 45% and
      full (1.6 s), its title in full ink, and "Needs you" in `foreground`
      after a breathing dot.
      - Program icon 15 (75% opacity when unfocused) and the title, 12.5 in
        `foreground` and medium weight when focused, `muted` otherwise.
      - The folder (`~/...`) and branch (with a branch glyph) as plain 11.5
        text.
      - At the right, the pane's status. On hover the status gives way to
        open with (a terminal pane only), split right, split down, zoom and
        close (15 icons).
      - Terminal padding is `[14, 10]`.
    - **Side panel**, at the right of the panes: 368 wide (280 to 900),
      hidden by default. It holds whichever panel is open: `kanso-panel`
      told `files`, `changes`, `pr` or `shipped` (`props.panel`), `kanso-spend`
      (Spend). A panel Kanso no longer has (Specs, before 2.0) closes.
      The Shipped panel (`kanso-panel` with `shipped`) is vanity metrics on
      purpose, drawn like Spend. It has:
      - a header: "Shipped" (20), a share icon and a refresh icon. Share
        opens a row: "Share to" X, LinkedIn, Bluesky, and "Save image"
        (outlined buttons, 26 tall), with a `dim` note under it.
        Sharing is one module for every panel, `share.js` (Spend has a
        byte-for-byte copy, since Herdr loads a mod's files from its own
        folder only; `npm run sync:share` copies it and a test fails when
        they differ). A panel hands it a card spec: a title and the
        period, a hero, numbers three to a row, a note, and blocks
        (`streak` with 53 columns of the calendar, `list`, `bars`).
        `shipped-card.js` makes Shipped's: @login and the period, the
        hero, the numbers, the totals, the streak, the records and when
        you ship. It has no repository or machine names. `share.js`
        draws a 1200-wide SVG, which becomes a PNG at 2x through the first
        renderer found: a Chromium browser headless (`--screenshot`),
        `rsvg-convert`, `magick`, or QuickLook on macOS. The PNG is saved
        to `~/Downloads`. For a network, the image is copied (`osascript`
        on macOS; `wl-copy` or `xclip` on Linux), the composer opens with
        the text filled in, and once the browser is in front and the page
        had a few seconds to load (3 to 5, by network) the image is pasted
        into it: System Events Cmd-V on macOS (needs Accessibility), `wtype`
        or `xdotool` on Linux. It never pastes into an app you moved to.
        When it can't paste, the toast says to paste it. The text is the
        big numbers and the streak plus the repository link, at most 280
        characters.
      - Day, Week, Month and Year tabs (26 tall, a `selected` wash on the
        active one), with previous and next arrows around the period's name
        ("This week", "Last week", "19 Oct – 25 Oct"). Next stops at now.
      - the hero: the lines added (56 and light; 40 under 560 wide), with
        the lines removed beside it (22, `muted`) and "lines shipped, this
        week". A green or red 6 dot gives the change against the period
        before, cut at the same point (a running week compares with the
        whole last one). It reads as a percentage, or as a multiple past
        double ("65x"). A day leads with its contributions instead, since
        GitHub's sums are weekly.
      - under the hero, light 28 numbers with 11 `dim` units: contributions,
        pull requests merged, commits, reviews and repositories. Then a
        `muted` line with your totals since you joined GitHub: pull requests
        merged, lines, commits and repositories.
      - "Streak": the current run of days with a contribution (40; today
        without one yet does not break it), and "longest N days" at the
        right. Then the calendar as GitHub draws it: as many whole weeks as
        fit the width, up to 53, with squares of 9 to 16 sized to fill it,
        3 apart. Each square is `accent` at alpha 40/70/b0/ff by GitHub's
        quartile, `hover` when empty, with a tooltip.
      - "Records": best day (contributions), best week and best month
        (lines), longest streak, and most commits in a week. Each is a
        hairline row with its detail in `dim` and its value (20, light) at
        the right. A record you just set (within the last week, or the last
        month for the best month, beating the stored one) shows a "New
        record" chip in `accent` and toasts once. Records keep the best ever
        seen in `shared("kanso.shipped.bests")`.
      - "When you ship": 24 bars (56 tall, radius 2) of the period's commits
        by local hour, the peak at full `accent` and the rest at alpha 90.
        Above them, "most at HH:00 · N% after 9 pm"; under them, the hours
        00 06 12 18 23 in `dim`. Then one hairline row per machine:
        `commits · +a −d`.
      - "By repository": the name, `commits · +a −d`, and a 4 tall `accent`
        bar by share; 8 rows, then "Show N more". A day shows its week.

      Where the numbers come from:
      - **GitHub, through `gh`.** One GraphQL query of counts per period:
        the period's and the compared period's contribution totals
        (`restrictedContributionsCount` included), merged pull request
        counts by search, the last year's calendar, and every pull request
        you ever merged. Your repositories: `repositoriesContributedTo`,
        plus those you reach as owner, collaborator or organization member.
        For each, `stats/contributors` gives your additions, deletions and
        commits per week on its default branch. A GitHub week counts from
        Sunday, UTC, so each is placed at its Monday noon. GitHub answers
        `{}` while it computes; that repository is asked again 5 s later,
        up to 6 times, then on the next refresh.
      - **This machine's git** (`shipped-store.js`). It reads the
        repositories of your panes and spaces, the ones read before, and
        any `.git` up to 4 levels under `~/Apps`, `~/Projects`, `~/Developer`,
        `~/code`, `~/src`, `~/dev`, `~/work`, `~/repos`, `~/git` and
        `~/github`. Each is named by its remote (`owner/name` on GitHub). It
        runs `git log --all --no-merges -F --author=…` for every identity of
        yours: GitHub login, name and noreply addresses, the global
        `user.email` and `user.name`, and those your other machines
        published. A repository is read again only when its refs change, and
        all of them when the identities change.
      - **Your other machines.** Each publishes its commits to a private
        gist, "Kanso Shipped stats", one `shipped-<host>.json` per machine
        (repositories, then `[repo, 12-character hash, time, adds, dels]`
        and its identities), and reads the others'. A commit counts once by
        repository and hash.

      Everything is kept in SQLite (`data/kanso-panel/shipped.db`, through
      the `sqlite3` command), statistics only: commits, GitHub's weeks,
      GitHub repositories with when each was pushed and read, scans, and
      meta. A repository's week counts the larger of the commits' sum and
      GitHub's. Each refresh reads only what changed. The panel rereads
      every 5 minutes while shown; a dim line names the step it is on.
      The PR panel (`kanso-panel` with `pr`) shows one pull request at a time: the focused
      pane's branch's own while it is open, as T3 Code does (a merged or closed
      one counts as none), else the newest open one in that repository
      ("the newest open; <branch> has none" after its author and age), drawn like the Spend panel: one
      centered column (max 1080, 16 px sides under 560 wide, else 32), no
      cards or uppercase labels, `canvas` behind, hierarchy from size, weight
      and tone, hairlines between list rows. Top to bottom:
      - Header: "Pull request" (17, 20 when wide), then at the right a
        hairline pill "N open" with a chevron, refresh (spins while reading),
        copy link (the PR's URL to the clipboard; a check for 1.5 s) and open
        on GitHub. The pill is hidden when the only open one is the
        one shown.
      - The page of open ones: the pill turns the panel to it (the title
        reads "Open pull requests", the pill "Back to #n"); it scrolls with
        the panel, as a popover's layer did not. The repository's open pull
        requests (`gh pr list --state open`, by anyone) under section titles
        with a count: This branch, Yours, Others. A row reads as the hero in
        small: the whole title (14, wraps; medium and on `selected` with
        "Shown" at the right when shown), then `#n · author ("you") · updated
        <age>` (11.5, dim), then a 6 dot and its state in its color (draft,
        checks failing, changes requested, checks running, approved, waiting
        for a review, checks passed) and `+a −d`. A click shows it and leaves
        the page; the branch's own goes back to following the branch. When
        the branch has none, the page ends with "Create one for <branch>".
        The page is titled "Pull requests" and starts with two tabs (26 tall,
        12, `selected` wash on the active one): "Open N", the page above, and
        "Closed", the repository's 30 most recently finished ones (`gh pr list
        --state closed`, read only when that tab opens), grouped the same way,
        each row with `merged <age>` or `closed <age>` and "Merged" (violet)
        or "Closed without merging" (red). A finished one is shown only when
        picked here; the pill is there whenever the pane is in a repository.
        Every `gh pr` action names the pull request by URL.
      - Hero: `#n · head → base` (15, muted); the title (22, 28 wide, light,
        line height 1.25); a 6 dot and the verdict (15): ready to merge
        (green), checks failing, conflicts or changes requested (red),
        checks running or waiting for a review (yellow, breathing), draft
        (dim), merged (`ansi5`), closed (red); author and age (12, dim).
        Then light numbers (22/28) with 12 dim units: files, added, removed,
        threads, checks. Then, while open, a 30-tall primary Merge button
        (`solid`; a second press within 4 s merges with the first method the
        repository allows; red while armed; disabled while draft,
        conflicting or blocked) and quiet links Ready for review or Back to
        draft, and Close. A closed PR offers Reopen.
      - Description: the PR's body as Markdown (`TextView.markdown`,
        selectable, 13, links open in the browser), template comments
        stripped. Past 6 lines or 480 characters it folds to 150 tall with
        "Show all" / "Show less". An empty body reads "No description." (dim).
      - People and labels, as T3 Code's meta rows: a 76-wide dim label,
        the values, and at the right a 22 icon button that opens T3 Code's
        candidate picker (a popover 288 wide: a search field, then the
        candidates with a check on those applied; a click applies or takes
        one back through GitHub's REST API and the picker stays open; a
        breathing silhouette while it reads; a note when the repository has
        more than 100). Assignees (with "Assign to me" when you aren't),
        Reviewers (who reviewed with the outcome, then who is still asked;
        the author is never offered) and Labels (chips in the label's own
        color at 15% with a dot of it). Candidates come from GraphQL
        `assignableUsers` (GitHub's own picker list, readable without push
        access) and the repository's labels, as in T3 Code.
      - Checks (when there are any): failing first, 5 shown, "Show N more";
        a row opens the check's page.
      - Unresolved threads (when there are any): the first comment, then
        path:line, author, replies, outdated; a row opens it on GitHub.
      - Ask your agent: Explain it, Address feedback (open PRs), Resolve
        conflicts (only when conflicting), as quiet links. Each opens a tab
        named `#<n> <task>` in the repository, running the first installed
        agent (`knownAgents`) with T3 Code's task prompt as its first message.
      - Files: name (13) over folder and add/delete mark (11, dim), +/- at the
        right; 8 shown, "Show N more"; a row shows its diff inline (first 400
        lines, monospace, in a hairline box).
      - A footnote (10.5, dim): read from GitHub with gh, when.
      - Loading is the view's silhouette in `border` tone, breathing between
        35% and 80%. Without a PR: "No pull request for <branch>." and
        "Create it on GitHub" (the web form, once the branch has an
        upstream). Errors read the same way, with "Try again". Outside a git
        repository it is a place, not a failure: "No repository here" in
        `muted`, no retry.
  - **Status bar**, 26 tall: `kanso-status` with `{side: "left"}`, a
    180-wide minimap (`kanso-strip`) exactly in the middle, and
    `kanso-status` with `{side: "right"}`. The minimap is a centred row of
    soft pills, one per column (6 + 18 x its share wide, 4 tall, gap 3, no
    frame): `muted` in view, `input` off-screen,
    `foreground` focused; a stacked column shows one 2px bar per pane. Click a pill to go there. After the pills, a tiny
    "− n +" control: fewer or more panes per view, and the number itself
    evens the columns out to 1/n.
    `kanso-status`, text 11.5 `muted`:
    - At the left, the machine (monitor or server icon, "This computer") and
      the branch.
    - At the right, "N agent(s) need you" in `blocked` with a dot (only when
      some agent is blocked), then a dot and "X of N working" (or "N agents
      idle" / "No agents"), then the palette shortcut "⌘⇧P" with the tooltip
      "Command palette".
- **Themes**: `kanso` (dark) and `kanso-day` (light), in `themes/`.
  - Dark: background `#1b1b19`, foreground `#d8d4cb`, chrome and canvas
    `#161615`, border `#272725`, input `#353430`, muted `#949086`, dim
    `#6b6862`, accent `#a3b09a`, working `#c4b07e`, blocked `#c99189`, done
    `#98ad8f`.
  - Light: background `#f4f1eb`, foreground `#3c3934`, chrome `#e3dfd6`,
    working `#8f7d52`, blocked `#9a6e68`, done `#6d7d62`.
- **Icons**: one Lucide-style set in `mods/kanso-chrome/icons/`, every one
  with the same stroke (2 on a 24 grid, 1.4 on a 16 grid), so they read as
  one family.

## How it behaves

- **Agent status**:
  - Working: a breathing dot in `working`, a 10px glyph cycling
    `· • ● •` every 450 ms (`.frames`). It shows on the tab, in the pane
    header, on the agent row and on the status bar dot. It is never a
    spinning icon.
  - Blocked: a `blocked` dot. The pane header adds the text "Needs you",
    the status bar says "N agent(s) need you", and a collapsed space shows
    its corner dot.
  - Done: a 6 `done` dot (tab, header, corner dot).
  - Idle: a 7 ring in `idle` on agent rows, with nothing on the tab or
    header.
- **Spaces**:
  - Click a space to select it. Clicking the space you are in folds or
    unfolds its agents; the folded state is kept.
  - Drag a space to reorder it (a 2px `accent` line shows where it lands).
    Double-click a space to rename it (Herdr's `space.rename` prompt).
  - Double-click a session row to rename the terminal: the same dialog
    Herdr opens for a space or a tab (`kanso-prompt`, 420 wide, with the
    name it shows now selected; Enter saves, Esc leaves it). The name is
    the terminal's own `kanso.name` label in herdr-core (`hc label <t>
    kanso.name=<name>`; empty removes it and the automatic name is back),
    so it survives a restart and the pane header, the edge tabs and the
    drop cards show the same name. Herdr has no terminal rename of its
    own; labels are its metadata.
    Right-click opens the shipped space menu.
  - Click a session row to focus its pane. Sessions are listed as T3 Code
    lists its threads: the pinned ones first, in the order you drag them,
    then the rest in the order chosen with the order button at the top of
    the sidebar (a Popover over the list, a check on the current one,
    remembered in localStorage `spaces.order`): last update (Herdr's `seq`,
    the default, as in T3 Code), needs you first (blocked, done, working,
    idle, then last update), by kind (agents by their program, then
    shells, then the rest), as on screen (the strip's order, tab by tab,
    with the panes stacked in one column held together in one soft slab,
    `foreground` at 3%, radius 6), or your own order (drag a session where
    you want it; per space, localStorage `spaces.custom`; new sessions
    join at the end by last update). The pin is the `kanso.pin` label on
    the terminal (its number is its place; pinning adds it last among the
    pinned, a drag among the pinned renumbers them through `hc label`),
    shown always on a pinned row and on hover on the rest; a click pins or
    unpins. A drag only reorders within its section (the pinned, or your
    order) and shows a 2px `accent` line where it lands; moving a pane in
    the strip is the header grip's job.
  - Every terminal in the space is listed, not only the agents that report
    a status to Herdr: after those come the rest (Codex and other models'
    CLIs, shells, servers) with their program's icon, their title (a shell's
    folder when the title says nothing) and no status mark.
- **Sidebar**:
  - Hide sidebar collapses it to a fixed 76 rail whose edge cannot be
    dragged.
  - Open, the edge drags between 200 and 480. The width you leave is
    remembered and used the next time you open it.
- **Tabs**:
  - Click selects a tab, drag reorders, double-click renames, and
    right-click opens the shipped tab menu.
  - Scrolling over the bar moves one tab per mouse-wheel notch, or per
    trackpad swipe (about 40px of travel).
- **The strip** (keys in `keys.json`, section `layout:kanso`; in Kanso they
  replace Herdr's tab keys, since the canvas is where you move):
  - Cmd+1 to Cmd+9 go to that pane; Cmd+[ and Cmd+] go to the previous and
    next one. The view glides to it (eases over about 0.3 s).
  - Cmd+D opens a pane to the right, Cmd+Alt+D to the left, Cmd+Shift+D
    below (stacked in the same column). The new pane is focused. The header's
    split buttons and the right-click menu do the same.
  - Cmd+W closes the focused pane. Cmd+Shift+[ and Cmd+Shift+] move it left
    and right. Cmd+Shift+Enter (or the header's zoom button) cycles its width
    1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1.
  - Cmd+Shift+- and Cmd+Shift+= show fewer or more panes per view (every
    column becomes 1/n, the focused one stays in view); Cmd+Shift+0 evens
    the columns out at the current count. `kanso-strip.per-N` sets N directly.
  - Cmd+Alt+Up/Down (or K/J) move the focus within a stacked column.
  - Kept as alternatives: Cmd+Alt+Left/Right or H/L (focus), with Shift
    (move), Cmd+Alt+1-9, Cmd+Alt+Home/End, Cmd+Alt+C (centre). There is no
    vertical move; those keys go to the program.
  - The wheel or a swipe over any pane header, an edge tab or the minimap slides the view
    one column per quarter view of travel (600px per view width) without
    moving the focus; if the focused pane leaves the view, the keyboard
    moves to the nearest pane still in view. Cmd+Alt+, and Cmd+Alt+. slide
    one column. Clicking an edge tab or a minimap mark slides to that pane.
  - Hold a header's six-dot grip (or Ctrl+drag the header) and drag onto
    another pane to move the pane. While a pane is held the strip is
    sorting: every pane's terminal gives its place to a drop card (a
    `kanso-strip` copy with `{drop: pane}`; the terminal lives on, the tree
    just stops showing it), so the whole pane takes the drop, not only its
    34px header. The card shows the pane's icon and name in `muted`,
    centered; the held pane's own card and header are at 40%. Over a card
    the pointer names a side: the left and right quarters mean a column of
    its own before or after that pane, the middle stacks it above (upper
    half) or below (lower half); the header counts as the pane's top (its
    middle means above) and the foot as its bottom (below). That side is
    shared `strip.drop` `{to, side}`, and header, card and foot draw from
    it: the half the held pane will take fills with `accent` at 25% and
    carries the held pane's icon and name in full ink, the resident's name
    steps to the other half, and the header's matching half (or all of it,
    for above) is washed the same. Any number of panes can stack; the 90px
    minimum height is the only limit. The edge tabs light in the accent too
    (brighter under the pointer): dropping there puts the pane just beyond
    that edge. Letting go on the held pane itself, the sidebar, the tab bar
    or the minimap moves nothing; a pane let go on a gutter stays held
    until the next press, or 12 s, then goes back. When the hold ends the
    terminals return and the keyboard goes back to the strip's focused pane.
- **Side panels, on demand**:
  - Clicking a panel button rewrites the panel stack to hold only that
    panel's block and shows it. Clicking it again, or closing the panel any
    other way, empties the stack. Herdr then ends that mod, and its timers,
    file watches and processes stop.
  - The open panel is remembered per space and restored when you switch
    spaces.
  - Files, Changes and PR are idle whenever they aren't the shown panel.
    PR rereads every minute while shown, every 20 s while a check runs.
- **Background**:
  - While the window is behind others, the spaces list checks git every 5 s
    instead of every 0.5 s.
  - `hc machine ls` runs every 30 s with the window in front, and every
    2 min with it behind.

## Built from

- **Layout tree** (`layouts/kanso.json`), root `row`, `titlebar: "none"`,
  `traffic_lights: [12, 16]`, `resizable: true`, `terminal_menu: "kanso-menu"`:
  - `sidebar` (column, `chrome`, 256 px, min 200, max 480):
    - `brand`: block `kanso-chrome` (Herdr's mark), 48 px, `window_drag`.
    - `spaces`: block `kanso-spaces`.
    - `sidebar-footer`: block `kanso-chrome` with `{footer: true}`, 156 px.
  - `work` (column, padding 6, gap 4):
    - `inset` (column, no fill, no border):
      - `tabs`: block `kanso-tabs`, 48 px, `window_drag`.
      - `work-body` (row, `chrome` background, gap 6):
        - `main`: `{tab: "active"}` with the `kanso-strip` header (height 34),
          radius 8, gap 6 and no pane borders. `kanso-strip` replaces it with
          the canvas's columns (`strip-*` nodes, `background`, radius 8) and
          puts it back for tabs it can't show.
        - `panel-body`: stack, 368 px (280 to 900), hidden, no children.
          `kanso-tabs` mounts the open panel in it.
    - `status-row` (row, 26 px): `status` (`kanso-status` `{side: "left"}`,
      weight 1), `strip-map` (`kanso-strip`, 180 px), `status-right`
      (`kanso-status` `{side: "right"}`, weight 1).
- **Mods**:
  - `kanso-spaces`: spaces, agents (`agents.js`), git per space via `exec`,
    machines via `hc machine ls`.
  - `kanso-tabs`: tabs, panel buttons and the on-demand panel mount via
    `layout.set`.
  - `kanso-strip`: the canvas. The copy in the status row is the controller
    and minimap; copies with `{edge, side, count, panes}` draw an edge rail. State per
    tab lives in shared `strip.state` (`{cols: [{panes, w, pin, hs}], vx,
    n}`; `hs` is each stacked pane's share of the height); the last chosen
    `n` is in shared `strip.n` for new tabs. Copies with `{ruler}` are the
    1px rulers; what they measure is in shared `strip.px`.
    Headers talk to it through shared `strip.req` (scroll, move, width, pin),
    `strip.intent` (where the next new pane goes), `strip.drag` (the held
    pane) and `strip.drop` (where it would land). Copies with `{drop}` are
    the cards that stand in for terminals while a pane is held.
    A `{pane, terminal}` copy (the app passes those to a header; the strip
    adds `strip: true`) is the pane header: icon, name, folder, branch,
    status, hover buttons, the grip and the wheel. Double-click it to
    rename the terminal (the same dialog and `kanso.name` label as the
    sidebar). The header lives in the strip so that one mod owns the
    drag, the drop zones, the names and the icons; Herdr doesn't let a mod
    import another's files.
  - `kanso-prompt`: Herdr's prompt dialog, copied, for what Herdr has no
    command for. Props `{title, value, hint}` and either `command: {name,
    args}` (runs it with `name`, as Herdr's prompt) or `label: {terminal,
    key}` (`hc label <terminal> <key>=<text>`; empty removes the label).
    Opened as a dialog 420 wide.
  - `kanso-menu`: the terminal right-click menu (root `terminal_menu`):
    split right, left and down through the strip, width, right-clicks
    to the program, send back, "Open with…" (when the pane has a folder),
    close.
  - `open-with`: a popup (380 wide, at the top; 340 at the pointer from the
    menu and the header) that opens a folder in a code editor. Props
    `{folder, machine}`; without them, the focused pane's folder. With
    `{file}` (a full path; the Files panel sends it on a right-click or
    its open button) the editors open that file, and a text file (by
    extension: md, txt, json, yaml, code and the like) is offered first to
    "Preview in the panel": `kanso-panel` with `{panel: "preview", path,
    on}` mounted in `panel-body` the way kanso-tabs mounts its panels. It lists the
    editors found on this computer (macOS app folders, `command -v`, Flatpak),
    the last one used first (shared `open-with.recent`), with each app's own
    icon on macOS. Enter, 1 to 9 or a click opens; Esc leaves. Terminal
    editors open with `terminal.open {place: "right"}`. A folder on another
    machine opens over SSH in the VS Code family (`--remote ssh-remote+<machine>`)
    and Zed (`ssh://<machine>/<path>`); the rest show "local only".
    Cmd+Shift+O (`mod.open:open-with`, in `keys.json`) opens it.
  - `kanso-chrome`: the top strip's mark and the sidebar footer, plus the icon set.
  - `kanso-status`: status bar.
  - `kanso-panel`: the side panels in one mod, chosen by `props.panel`;
    each is a plain class in its own file (`files.js`: lazy file tree via
    `sh`, git status marks, a file shown in place: Markdown rendered, else
    read-only code; `changes.js`: git diff and commit; `pr.js`: the pull
    request panel, read with `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff` and one GraphQL
    query for unresolved review threads; `preview.js`: one file by full
    path, `{path, on}`, drawn the same way, read again whenever its folder
    changes, with Open with, read-again and close buttons) and `lib.js`
    holds what they share (where the focused pane is, diff rows, the two
    file renderers: `codeState` is a read-only `EditorState` in the
    terminal's font with the theme's ANSI hues, `markdownView` is the
    SDK's `TextView.markdown`, selectable, in a scrolling column with 16 px
    sides; and `showPanel`, which mounts a block in `panel-body`). A panel
    exists only while `kanso-tabs` shows it, so it never polls the layout
    to learn whether it is visible.
  - All are derived from Herdr's shipped mods (Apache-2.0) through the 0OZ
    and minimalistic forks, and all use `"place": "none"`.
- Spend (`kanso-spend`) is included. Specs (`sdd-focused`, by José
  Gutiérrez, from the minimalistic layout) was offered when installed, up to
  1.5; Kanso no longer shows it.
- **Herdr functions**: `spaces`, `panes`, `agents`, `terminals`, `machines`,
  `layout`, `theme`, `shared`/`setShared`, `window`, `exec`, `hc`,
  `watchFolder`, `readTextFile`, `openOverlay`, `run`, `home`, `appHome`,
  `updates`.
- **Commands**: `layout.set`, `layout.resize`, `space.*`, `tab.*`, `pane.*`,
  `app.settings`, `app.palette`, `mod.open` (`picker`, `machine-add`,
  `open-with`), `terminal.open`.
- **Shipped overlays used**: `menu`, `new-menu`, `picker`, `machine-add`.
- **Programs run**: `git` (spaces, Files, Changes), `sh` (Files listing),
  `hc` (machines) and, for Open with, `sh`, `open`, `plutil` and `sips`
  (macOS) and the chosen editor. The PR panel runs `gh` (GitHub's API) and
  `git`, only while it is shown. Nothing else reaches the network.

## Watch out

- A layout may nest at most 16 levels (`layout.set` refuses deeper ones).
  Put the strip's columns directly in `work-body` (column > cell column >
  block), never inside another row.
- Herdr folds the layout on its own: empty containers go, containers with a
  single child are replaced by that child, and terminal blocks whose
  terminal ended go. Never rely on an empty column for space (use a filler
  block) or on a single-child wrapper's id. The side panel's toggle lives on
  `panel-body` itself for that reason.
- Herdr won't let a mod handle the mouse over terminal text, so a hold on a
  grip takes the terminals out of the tree for its duration and puts drop
  cards in their place: that is how the whole pane, not only its header,
  can show where the held pane lands and take the drop. Nothing tells a mod
  about a release over a gutter (no `on_mouse_up_out`), hence the
  next-press and 12 s ends. Resizing isn't a mod's drag at all: it is
  Herdr's divider, read back afterwards.
- A host argument nests at most 16 levels, and the layout tree counts each
  node and its `children` array: there is no room for a wrapper around the
  strip's columns in `work-body`, which is why the rulers sit inside the
  columns and at the row's start instead.
- Herdr's divider moves only the two nodes beside it and never a fixed one
  (`min` = `max`). The side panel's border must have a strip column on its
  left: the 1px height ruler stands at the row's start, and while a panel
  shows, every layout writer puts the strip's right edge rail
  (`strip-edge-right`) after the panel (`edgeBesidePanel`), so the panel
  can be dragged between 280 and 900 wide.
- A terminal block takes the keyboard on click, so `focused().pane` is null
  and implicit pane commands fail. Pass `pane` or `terminal` explicitly
  (`pane.split {pane}`, `pane.focus {terminal}`), and focus a new pane only
  once its block is in the layout.
- Herdr's own focus stays on a tab's model pane, and lands there whenever you
  come to a tab (another space or tab, a layout switch, a restart). That pane
  isn't on screen, so the keyboard would go nowhere until a click. The strip
  remembers the selected pane per tab (`focus` in "strip.state") and, when a
  model pane holds the focus, hands it to a block: the remembered pane on
  coming back, or the model pane itself when Herdr's focus moved to a new one
  (an agent notification, a closed pane). Otherwise it leaves the keyboard
  alone, so a side panel you click keeps it.
- Herdr's own terminal menu passes a terminal block's id (`term-<pane>`) as
  its target pane, so its Split and Close fail with "no pane". Kanso ships
  its own menu, which finds the real pane from the clicked terminal.
- Cap layout writes: the strip writes only when its tree changes, at most
  once every 100 ms (checked before it reads the tree, so a skipped write
  costs nothing; a burst writes its first step at once and then its latest
  state), and pauses itself for 10 s if more than 30 writes in 3 s ever get
  past that, so a mistake can't keep the window busy.
- `layout.set` replaces the whole tree, and a set that has not landed still
  reads as the old one. The strip, the tabs, the panel and the sidebar keep
  their piece in shared state and put all three back on every write, so one
  writer cannot drop another's: the strip's columns in `kanso.layout.strip`
  (`nodes`, `sizesBefore`), written by the strip alone so it never reads the
  rest back, and the panel and rail in `kanso.layout` (`panel`, `rail`).
  The strip also records `sizesBefore`: other writers preserve new native
  divider sizes while its adopt timer catches up, but replay pending strip
  width commands over the old sizes they were based on.
- On Unix, Files lists a folder with one `find -print0` and no shell: a
  directory is printed twice in a row (no name repeats in a folder), so its
  type costs no extra call, and NUL separators keep names with newlines
  whole. It keeps 501 entries and displays 500, the extra one only to detect
  truncation. If `find` can't run or its output passes exec's 8 MiB, it falls
  back to Bash reading the same `find` with a bounded loop.

- Never use `.spin()` for a busy state. It redraws the whole window about
  30 times a second while any agent works, and every redraw repaints every
  visible terminal. Use `.frames` with a slow period.
- A block stays alive while it is in the layout, even hidden. On-demand
  panels must be removed from the tree (`layout.set`), not only hidden.
  `kanso-tabs` reconciles: hidden with a child unmounts it, shown with none
  mounts the remembered panel. It waits up to 1 s for its own `layout.set`
  to land before reading the state as a choice.
- `layout.set` only works on a personal layout. Kanso is one once copied in,
  but the shipped `main` is not.
- The collapsed rail must be at least 76 wide on macOS, or the traffic
  lights overlap the tab bar. Its non-resizable state lives on the root row
  (`resizable`) together with the sidebar's `min`; `kanso-spaces` sets both
  with `layout.set` when you fold or open the sidebar, and once at start.
- Read `panes()`, `spaces()` and `layout()` once per render. Each read copies
  the whole list.
- Keep one-time fixes (`kanso.row`) in `init`, never in `render`.
- The macOS window layout (traffic lights, the empty top strip) assumes
  `titlebar: "none"`.
- Mod names are prefixed `kanso-`, so they can sit beside the minimalistic
  layout's `mn-*` mods.

## Done when

- Right-click a terminal, "Open with…": the popup names that pane's folder
  and lists the installed editors; picking one opens that folder in it.
- In a repository whose branch has an open PR, the PR panel shows its title,
  checks, review, mergeability, unresolved threads and files; clicking a file
  shows its diff, and Explain opens an agent tab with the task.
- `herdr-app check` passes for all eight `kanso-*` mods and `open-with`, and
  `herdr-app status` shows no errors after `layout.switch {name: "kanso"}`.
- With no panel open, `panel-body` in the layout file has no children. After
  clicking Files it holds exactly one `files` block, and closing it empties
  it again.
- With the panel closed, no process started by Files, Changes or Insights is
  running.
- A working agent shows a breathing dot (not a spinner) on its tab, header
  and agent row. A blocked one shows "Needs you" in its header and in the
  status bar.
- Collapsed, the sidebar is 76 wide, its edge does not drag, and the traffic
  lights sit inside it. Opened, it drags between 200 and 480 and reopens at
  the width you left.
- One trackpad swipe over the tab bar moves exactly one tab.
- At 3 per view, Cmd+D three times from one pane gives four columns at a
  third each; the view slides to the new one and the minimap shows four
  pills. Cmd+Shift+= makes it 4 per view and all four fit; Cmd+Shift+- twice
  goes back to 2 per view with the focused pane still in view.
- Dragging the gutter between two columns 200px right on a 1200px view
  makes the left one a sixth of the view wider and the right one that much
  narrower; a quarter second later the minimap pills show the new shares,
  and sliding the view or opening a pane keeps them.
- Dragging the gutter between two stacked panes gives one the height the
  other loses; Cmd+Shift+0 evens them out again.
- Cmd+Alt+Left past the first column in view slides the view.
- Pin the left pane of three and scroll: it stays at the left, whole, while
  the others slide beside it. Ctrl+dragging it, Cmd+Shift+] and dropping a
  pane on it change nothing. Pinning panes that would leave under a fifth of
  the view does nothing.
- Select the second of three panes, go to another space and back: that pane
  takes typing at once, with no click, and its header is the lighter one.
  An agent asking for input tints its pane's header in `blocked`.
  Cmd+Shift+Enter makes the focused column 2/3 wide without changing any
  other column.
- Dragging a grip onto the right half of another header moves that pane
  after it; onto the left half, before it. Ctrl+drag does the same.

## Spend (`kanso-spend`)

Spend opens from the tab bar like the other panels: the `insights` panel id,
mounted with `{ mod: "kanso-spend" }`. It was the separate herdr-token-spend
mod. On its first start it copies `data/token-spend` to `data/kanso-spend`
when the new folder has no store yet. Its `mod.json` has `"place": "none"`, so
Herdr never docks a copy on its own.

A quiet panel that shows what your AI coding sessions would cost at API list price: per period, per model, per project and per task. It reads the session files Claude Code, Codex, Pi and OpenCode already write on this machine, prices every token, and shows one large figure, a thin daily chart and short lists you can open for detail. It works only while you can see it: hidden or closed, it runs nothing.

### What you see

Everything sits in one centered column, max 1080 px wide, with 32 px side padding (16 px under 560 px wide). There are no cards, boxes or uppercase labels. Hierarchy comes from type size, weight and tone. Every color is a token mapped from `theme()` in `ui.js`: `canvas` behind everything, `foreground` for primary text, `muted` and `dim` for secondary text, `border` for hairlines, `accent` used only for the chart peak and the live dot.

Top to bottom:

1. **Header.** On the left, "Spend" at 20 px (17 px when narrow). Inside a detail view, a back arrow, a small dim crumb ("Project", "Model", "Task") and the item name instead. On the right, two 26 px icon buttons: refresh (it spins while an update runs) and a gear for Settings. During the first scan, "Reading sessions, N of M" appears in 11 px dim text beside them.
2. **Controls.** Text tabs "Month", "30 days", "Year", "All time" at 13 px: the selected one in full tone and medium weight, the others dim. On the right, two text menus, "All projects ⌄" and "All models ⌄", which open popovers listing every option with its cost. When a filter is set, "Showing <name>" appears with a "Show everything" link.
3. **Hero.** The period name (for example "October 2026") at 15 px, with ‹ and › to step back and forward, plus "Back to now" once you are in the past. Below it, the total at 72 px light weight (48 px under 560 px), with "API value" at 13 px dim beside it. Then a dim line comparing it with the previous period ("14% more than September"). Then a row of 28 px light numbers, each with a 12 px dim unit: tasks, per task, "a month" (Year and All time only), and tokens.
4. **Chart.** One vertical line per day (Month, 30 days) or per month (Year, All time), 132 px tall at most. Lines are 2 px in `muted` at 55% opacity. The peak is 3 px in `accent`, with its value written above it. Empty days are a 1 px stub in `border`. The first and last dates and "Per day"/"Per month" sit underneath at 10 px. Hovering a line shows the day, cost and tokens.
5. **Active now.** Sessions whose transcript changed in the last 30 minutes, newest first, up to 5. The heading has a 6 px accent dot that breathes slowly. Each row shows the ticket (if any), the title, then tool, model, project and "active now" or "N min ago", with the cost on the right in 17 px light weight. The cost covers the whole session, regardless of the period and filters.
6. **Projects and Models.** Two lists side by side from 860 px wide, stacked below that. Each row shows the name, then the tokens dim, then the cost at 15 px light weight, right-aligned. 6 rows are visible, with "Show N more" below. Hovering a model shows its price per million tokens and where that price came from.
7. **Tasks.** Rows separated by hairlines: the ticket key in medium dim text, then the title (the start of the first prompt), then a meta line (project, main model, date range, "N sessions"), and the cost and tokens on the right. 8 rows are visible, with "Show N more" below.
8. **Footnote.** Two lines at 10.5 px dim: where the prices come from, and how tasks are grouped.

**Loading** is never a spinner. It is the view's own silhouette, drawn in `border` tone: blocks where the figure, stats, rows and chart lines will be. The whole shape fades between 35% and 80% opacity over 1.8 s, using one native `.loop`. While a filter or period change is priced, the current view drops to 55% opacity instead.

**Detail views:**

- **Project:** the same page filtered to that project, without the project list and without Active now.
- **Model:** the same page filtered to that model, without the model list and without Active now.
- **Task:** the ticket, the full first line of the prompt at 15 px, then project, tools and dates. Below that, the cost at 60 px with an Input / Output / Cache read / Cache write row, a Models list and a Sessions list (each row with its cost), and an "Open <project>" link.

**Settings:**

- **Sources:** a toggle per source (Pi, Codex, OpenCode, Claude Code), with the folders it reads.
- **Plans:** rows with a name and a dollar amount per month. There are "Add plan" and "Save plans" links, and a remove icon on each row.
- **Prices** and **Updates:** a short paragraph each, explaining where prices come from and when the panel updates.

### How it behaves

- **Price.** A row's cost is input × input rate + output × output rate + cache read × cache rate + cache write × cache write rate, from these sources in order:
  1. A per-model override in `data/kanso-spend/prices.json` (`"models": {"<model>": {"input": 4, "output": 20, "cacheRead": 0.2}}`, in USD per 1M tokens).
  2. Anthropic's first-party list prices for `claude-opus-5-5` ($4 / $20, cache read $0.20), `claude-fable-5-1` ($10 / $50, $0.25) and `claude-sonnet-5-5` ($2 / $10, $0.20). A cache write costs 1.25× input, or 2× input for Claude Code rows, because Claude Code writes its cache with the 1-hour TTL.
  3. The OpenRouter model catalog (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`), fetched at most once a day and cached. The model name is matched after the last `/`; a dated or suffixed id matches its base, and the provider's first word is tried as a vendor prefix (`kimi-coding/k3` matches `moonshotai/kimi-k3`).
  4. Free models and local runtimes are $0. Anything else is counted as unpriced: it is never guessed.
- **Tasks.** A task is a ticket when one of the session's first four prompts names one: a link to Jira, Linear, ClickUp, a GitHub issue or PR, a Google Doc or Notion, or a bare key like `WEB-142`. Otherwise the task is the session. Its title is the session's `/name` (Pi), else the ticket, else the first line of the first real prompt, cut to 120 characters. Harness boilerplate (`<environment_context>`, `# AGENTS.md`, `<system-reminder>`, `[Image #1]`) is skipped. Only that line and the ticket refs are stored, never the transcript.
- **Previous period.** The comparison note is against the period of the same length just before: the previous month, the previous 30 days, or the previous year. "All time" shows the monthly average instead.
- **Clicks.**
  - A project, model, task or live session row opens its detail. Back (the arrow, Esc or ⌘[) returns one level and restores the filters you had. Details nest: project → task → back → back.
  - Period tabs and ‹ › re-price without a new scan.
  - A Sources toggle re-indexes; turning a source off removes it from every number.
  - "Save plans" writes `plans` into `prices.json`, keeping its other keys. The hero then shows what your plans cost in the period and how much they saved you.
- **Keys** (from `keys.json`, only while the panel has focus): ⌘R refresh, ⌘, Settings, Esc and ⌘[ back.
- **When it runs.** A copy starts the first time it shows. While visible, it refreshes every 60 s, or every 30 s while any session is active. Hidden (a closed panel column, another child of its stack, a hidden ancestor), its timer stops, its data is dropped and no process runs. When shown again, it reloads within a second, woken by the `kanso-spend.open` command or by its next render. A side-panel toggle should run `run("kanso-spend.open")` after showing it.
- **First run.** Herdr stops an `exec` after 30 s, so each scan stops at 18 s, saves what it read and continues a second later. A history of about 1400 sessions takes two passes. Afterwards a refresh reads only files that changed (about 0.6 s).
- **Sample data.** Create `data/kanso-spend/demo` (any content) to show sample data instead of your sessions, for screenshots. Delete it to go back.

### Built from

- **`mods/kanso-spend/main.js`** (the view, QuickJS). One `View` class. Its state is the cost options `{period, offset, project, model}`, a navigation stack, `page` (home or settings), the last payload, and a single-flight runner: one presenter call at a time; a request made meanwhile is queued, and a scan wins over a re-price. Every call is `exec(node, [presenter, command, --store, --home, --options JSON])`, where `node` comes from `runtime.json`. A 35 s watchdog per call shows "took too long" instead of hanging.
  - herdr functions: `exec`, `appHome`, `home`, `theme`, `layout`, `nextCommand`, `readTextFile`, `writeTextFile`.
  - gpui-base controls: `Button`, `Popover`, `Input`, `InputState`, and `Toggle` (through `ui.js`).
  - Native animation: `svg().spin(900)` for the refresh icon, `.loop("opacity", …)` for the skeleton and the live dot.
  - Commands: `kanso-spend.refresh`, `.open`, `.settings`, `.back`.
- **`mods/kanso-spend/presenter.mjs`** (Node 22.15+).
  - `snapshot` runs the collector, updates task labels (time-boxed to 25 s since start), refreshes the price catalog if it is stale and fewer than 16 s have passed, then derives costs.
  - `prepare` derives costs from the stored index without scanning.
  - `configure --sources '{"codex": false}'` changes which sources are enabled, then scans.
  - Output is one JSON line, `{kind: "kanso-spend-costs", version: 1, scan, costs, settings}`, about 35–60 KB, with every number and label already formatted as text.
- **`collector.mjs` and `core/`:**
  - `config.mjs`: the sources and their roots: `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`, `~/.local/share/opencode` (SQLite through `node:sqlite`), and `~/.claude/projects`.
  - `adapters.mjs`: parses each harness's records into token usage. Claude Code repeats a message's usage on several lines; dedupe it by message id and request id.
  - `scan.mjs`: incremental by file size and mtime. `.jsonl.zst` archives are checked with one decompress pass before any change, and an 18 s budget applies per scan.
  - `store.mjs`: the index in `data/kanso-spend/spend.db` (`node:sqlite`, WAL): tables `meta`, `files`, `dedup` and `tasks`, one JSON row per entry, keys stored as JSON strings (file keys hold a NUL, which SQLite text cuts). A save writes only the entries that changed, in one transaction; a read for display skips `dedup`, which only scans use. A `store.json` from before is moved in by the first writer and kept as `store.json.migrated`. Rows are day × session × harness × provider × model × project.
  - `labels.mjs`: task titles and tickets, in `labels.json`. Pi sessions reuse pi-usage's cache (`~/.prjct/pi-usage/scan.json`) when it exists.
  - `costs.mjs`: rates, periods, grouping, and all display text.
  - `demo.mjs`: the sample data.
- **`ui.js`:** the theme token mapping and a few helpers (`toggleSwitch`, `controlInput`).
- **`share.js` and `spend-card.js`:** Share, the same as Shipped's (see `kanso-panel/share.js`, of which this is a byte-for-byte copy; `npm run sync:share`). A share icon in the header, shown only on the home view with no project or model filter; it opens the "Share to" row. `spend-card.js` turns the costs into the card: "Spend" and the period, the total "of AI work at API list price", the rise against the period before (only a rise), tasks, per task, tokens, the project and model counts, the plan note, and the chart's bars by ratio with its first and last labels. No names reach it.
- **`icons/`:** `refresh`, `settings`, `back`, `close` and `share`, as 24 px stroke-2 line SVGs drawn with `svg()` and tinted by text color.
- **Network:** one HTTPS GET a day to the OpenRouter catalog. **Programs:** `node`. **Files read outside the mod:** the four session folders above and, if present, `~/.prjct/pi-usage/`. **Files written:** only under `data/kanso-spend/`.

### Watch out

- **QuickJS runs every script step under a time limit.** A step that parses a large `exec` result can be cut off silently: the view is left with no data and no error. Keep the payload small (well under 100 KB) and send strings already formatted. Never send raw rows to the view.
- **Render has about 50 ms.** Build menu options in event handlers, not in `render`. Create `InputState` only in `init` or event handlers. Keep fewer than about 100 rows on screen.
- **`exec` is killed at 30 s.** A first scan of a long history will not fit, so it must save progress and continue. Don't `structuredClone` the whole store per archive as a rollback point: at 14 MB that is about 0.3 s per file, and it was the original cause of timeouts.
- **Hidden copies keep their timers.** Check the layout before doing work, and drop data when hidden. `<mod>.<command>` only reaches shown copies.
- **Codex `input_tokens` already includes cached tokens.** Subtract `cached_input_tokens` to get uncached input. Output already includes reasoning tokens; don't add them twice.
- **Catalog matching.** Sort the catalog longest id first, so `gpt-6-sol-pro` doesn't swallow `gpt-6-sol`.
- **OpenRouter prices.** Some catalog cache rates differ from Anthropic's own, which is why the first-party table wins for Claude models.
- **Runtime.** `runtime.json` must point at Node 22.15 or newer: zstd archives need `zlib.createZstdDecompress`, and OpenCode needs `node:sqlite`. `"node"` works when it is on the login PATH.
- **The folder name is a constant (`MOD`) at the top of `main.js`.** Asset paths, the data folder and command names all derive from it.

### Done when

- `herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/kanso-spend` passes.
- With `data/kanso-spend/demo` present, the panel shows a period total, a chart with one marked peak, five projects, five models and ticketed tasks such as "WEB-142 Add rate limiting to the public API".
- Without it, the figures match a hand count from one transcript, for example a Claude Code session's deduplicated usage priced at the rates above.
- Clicking a project shows its detail, back restores the previous filters, and a task opens its breakdown.
- Settings toggles a source, the totals change, and "Save plans" writes `prices.json`.
- With the panel hidden for two minutes, no `presenter.mjs` process appears and the store's modification time does not change.
- A fresh install with a long history finishes its first index over several refreshes, without a timeout error.
