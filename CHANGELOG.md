# Changelog

Every change to what Kanso installs, newest first. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): a release that lists Breaking or
Removed changes is a major version, one that lists Added or Deprecated is a
minor version, anything else is a patch. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). `npm run check:version`
checks all of this, and merging to main releases the version in
`kanso/mods/kanso-chrome/version.json`, which is what the updater offers.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- Less work per frame. The sidebar reads each space's place once per look instead of once per space, lists sub-agents from one map instead of a search per row, and reads the strip's columns once per draw; Threads reads four conversations at a time instead of one after another; the strip leaves the layout tree alone while the window is behind others; Shipped adds up a period's weeks once per reading instead of three times per draw; the PR panel reads its checks once per reading; Files rebuilds its rows only when they changed; Send reads the names you gave once per draw.
- One copy of what the mods share, kept in step by `npm run sync:share` and a test: the layout writers' helpers (`layout.js`, in kanso-tabs, kanso-strip, kanso-spaces, kanso-panel and open-with), the panels' kit (`ui.js`: colors, spacing, quiet links, icon buttons, section heads, loading silhouettes and the second press that confirms, in kanso-panel and kanso-spend) and, in `marks.js`, a program's icon and a pane's name along with the state mark (now in kanso-send too). Spend's unused drawing helpers are gone.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- The sidebar shows what your agents are doing. Each agent's row has, at the right, how long it has been working, waiting on you or since it finished, and under its name a quiet line: while it works or waits, its own title when you gave it a name of yours; when it finishes, what it left in its folder (+12 −3 · 1 commit · PR #41). Read from the state the agent reports, its title and git, never from its conversation.
- Sub-agents (started by an agent with `hc run`) are listed under their parent with tree lines; a click opens one in a peek.
- Projects, Status and Threads, a switch at the top of the sidebar. Projects is the list you had. Status lists every agent in every project by what it needs from you (Needs you, Working, Done, Idle, then the other terminals), each with its project and time; a parent goes where its most urgent sub-agent would, and a finished agent you are looking at stays in Done until you leave it. Each section folds. Status carries a dot while an agent needs you and you are on another view.
- Threads lists each conversation of the agents on this computer, named on its own: the title Claude Code gives it, or Codex's name for it, kept up to date as it goes; else the first thing you wrote. Under it, its project and the last thing you wrote. Read from the files the agents already keep, only while Threads shows; nothing is stored or sent.
- Threads works as T3 Code's sidebar: Pinned up top, then the rest by your last message or when it started (or grouped by project), then Snoozed and Settled, folded. Settle puts a finished thread away until it has new work; Snooze hides it for an hour, three, until this evening, tomorrow or Monday, and it comes back marked Woke; Mark unread, Rename thread (empty brings its own title back), Copy folder, branch or conversation id, and Close agent (after a second click). Hover a thread for Settle and Pin; right-click any row, in any view, for the rest. Kept as labels on the terminal, so every window and a restart agree.
- The sort button sorts in the view's terms: in Status within each section (latest change, longest in its state, project), in Threads by your last message or when it started, grouped by project or not.
- Status and Threads rows lead with their project's square and name in its color. An agent's state is one mark everywhere, the tabs, the pane headers, the status bar and the sidebar: one circle: an arc running on a faint ring while it works, the circle closed as a brush ensō when it is done, a solid disc when it needs you, a faint ring at rest. It replaces the breathing dot. A working agent's title shimmers, a glint passing over its letters with three dots counting after it, as Claude Code's own status does; names keep one weight, so nothing jumps when an agent starts or stops.
- Threads get more room than the other views: taller rows with space between them, read as conversations. While Threads first reads the conversations it shows the view's silhouette, as Spend does.
- Under Show in the sort button, turn off the activity line or the switch (then the sidebar stays on Projects).

### Changed

- The sidebar calls its rows agents, not sessions.
- A title that is only a path (`~/Apps/x`) no longer names a row: a shell is named after its folder, as intended.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- Cmd+J goes to the next agent waiting on you, in any space: one blocked on a question first, then one that finished while you weren't looking. Press it again for the one after. A click on "N agents need you" in the status bar does the same.
- Pane headers say what an agent left in its folder when it stops working: changed files with lines added and removed, commits not yet upstream, and its open pull request with a dot for the checks. Read from git and gh once per turn, never from the conversation.
- Send to an agent (the pane header's send button, the pane menu, or Cmd+Alt+S): pick another agent, edit the message, and Send pastes it into that agent's terminal and presses Enter, then takes you there. An agent waiting on its own question is never typed into.
- Arrangements (the layers button beside +, or Cmd+Alt+T): save a tab as it is, with each pane's program and the flags you started it with, its folder, the columns, stacks and widths, and open it again in a new tab with one click. Kept per project; a resumed session's id is left out, so each agent starts fresh.
- Ports: a panel of the dev servers listening on this computer, with the pane that runs each. The ones no pane runs any more are marked, and Stop ends them after a second press.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- Spaces: a new space from This computer's + or New space is made on this computer, and the top + makes it on the active space's machine. Before, both could land on the last remote machine you focused (#36).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Worktrees: a panel that finds every git worktree on your computer, in your repositories' folders and wherever agents left them (temp folders and scratchpads included), with how much disk they take and what each one holds: merged (squash merges included), commits kept on its branch, uncommitted changes, commits only there, or in use. Clean up removes, after a second press, every one that loses nothing and has been idle a day, and deletes the merged branches; one at a time or a whole repository, it says first what would be lost. Folders whose repository moved or was deleted are listed too. A worktree whose repository moved (its `.git` names the old place) is never removed: Repair the link reconnects it. Each one is checked again right before it goes, and one that changed since the scan stays instead of failing.
- Worktrees keeps a history in SQLite (`data/kanso-panel/worktrees.db`): each worktree once, rewritten only when it changes, and the gone ones with the size they freed, whether removed here or elsewhere. Freed shows the total, the worktrees, merged branches and leftovers cleared, and 30 days of what was freed and of what the worktrees took. The panel opens on the last scan while it checks again.
- Worktrees: Share posts an image to X, LinkedIn or Bluesky with the totals only, never a repository, branch or folder name: what was freed, or before that, what the worktrees take.
- Worktrees: Explain it on a worktree, or Review the ones that need a look, asks your agent in a new tab what that work is and whether it already lives somewhere else. The agent changes nothing.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- The button of the open panel shows its name beside its icon, so you can tell which panel is open without hovering it.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- The panel buttons at the top right are icons; the one under the pointer shows its name beside it. Press one and let go on another to move it there. Right-click one to open Panels, where you drag them into order and turn each one on or off. The order and the switches are kept for every space.

### Removed

- Specs (the separate `sdd-focused` mod) is no longer offered in the tab bar, and a Specs panel left open closes. Kanso never included it; remove `mods/sdd-focused` if it is installed.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Spend is part of Kanso. It shows what your AI coding sessions cost at API list price, per model, project and task, and it ships with the layout: its button is always in the tab bar. It was the separate token-spend mod; its first start carries that mod's data over, and its keys are now under `mod:kanso-spend` (#32).
- Spend: Share to X, LinkedIn or Bluesky, or save the image, the same way as Shipped. The image has only the totals of the unfiltered view: what the period is worth, tasks, tokens, how many projects and models, and the days. Never a project, task or session name; the button hides while a filter or a detail is open (#32).

### Changed

- Spend keeps its index in SQLite, `data/kanso-spend/spend.db`, instead of one JSON file: a scan writes only what changed, and opening the panel skips what only scans need. The first scan moves `store.json` in and keeps it as `store.json.migrated` (#32).
- Sharing pastes the image into the post for you: the composer opens with the text, and once the page is up the image goes in. On macOS this needs Herdr in Accessibility; without it, the toast says to paste it. Shipped and Spend share through one module (#32).

### Fixed

- Spend no longer docks a second panel at the window's right edge when it is installed (`"place": "none"`) (#32).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Shipped: Share to X, LinkedIn or Bluesky, or save the image. It makes a PNG of the global numbers only: the totals, the streak with a year of contributions, the records and when you ship. No repository or machine names. It copies the image to paste into the post, and opens the composer with the words filled in, because these networks take only text from a link (#31).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- Kanso looks for its own releases when Herdr starts and every 5 minutes, instead of every 6 hours, so a release shows within minutes. `kanso-chrome.check` looks right away and says whether you are up to date (#30).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Shipped (#29): a side panel of vanity metrics for what you delivered, drawn like Spend. It covers every repository and organization, by day, week, month or year, and shows:
  - the lines you added and removed, compared with the period before;
  - contributions (private ones included), pull requests merged, commits, reviews and repositories;
  - your totals since you joined GitHub;
  - your streak, with a heat map that fills the panel, up to a year;
  - your records (best day, best week, best month, longest streak, most commits in a week), with a toast when you set one;
  - when in the day you ship, and from which machine;
  - a breakdown by repository.

  Each machine reads its own git (every branch, every identity you commit with) into a local SQLite store of statistics only (repository, hash, time, lines, machine), and your machines share it through a private gist. GitHub's weekly contributor sums cover what no machine has cloned. A repository's week counts the larger of the two, and each refresh reads only what changed.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- PR panel: the list's new Closed tab shows the repository's 30 most recently merged or closed pull requests. Like the open ones, they are grouped as this branch, yours, and your colleagues'. A finished pull request shows only when you pick it (#28).

### Fixed

- PR panel: a branch's merged or closed pull request no longer opens as the branch's own. The newest open one stands in, or the panel offers to create one (#28).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Kanso updates itself, apart from Herdr. When there is a newer release, an "Update Kanso to X" row appears above Settings, with one toast per version. Installing it checks every mod first, keeps the keys you changed, and keeps your previous layout as `layouts/kanso.json.old-<time>` (#26).
- `kanso.panels` in `shared.json`: other mods can add their own side panels to the tab bar (#25, by Iván Campaña).

### Fixed

- Specs and Insights show in the tab bar only when their mods are really installed (#24, by Iván Campaña).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-03

The first release. It holds everything from the first commit (31 October 2026) to the v1.0.0 tag.

### Added

- Kanso: a quiet Herdr layout with side panels that open on demand (Files, Changes), light and dark themes (`kanso-day`, `kanso`), and a recipe to rebuild it (5db1c86).
- An endless horizontal strip of panes with a minimap, keyboard navigation, and a view that glides to the focused pane (b245258, 77215ff, c4b12fd, 437c17a).
- Choose how many panes fit in the view, from 1 to 8, and resize them on the dividers (6c9fe03).
- A grip that moves a pane before or after another (736918f).
- A terminal menu that knows about the strip (2eccd5f).
- Open with: open a pane's folder in a code editor (#1).
- PR panel: the branch's pull request, managed from Kanso (#2).
- Focus memory, pinned panes, and a sidebar that lists and reorders every session (#3).
- Drop a pane to stack it. Stacked panes are linked in the sidebar, and a preview shows where a held pane will land (#6).
- Preview a file in the side panel from Open with, without an editor (#9).
- Order the sidebar's sessions: pinned first, then by last update, attention, kind, screen order, or your own order (#10).
- PR panel: lists every open pull request in the repository, with a quiet state outside a repository (#12).
- PR panel: one pull request at a time, with the open ones in a dropdown (#16).
- Strip: a swipe over an edge tab slides the view too (#17).
- PR panel: the description and a copy-link button (#21).
- Strip: the selected pane has a fine accent border (#22).

### Changed

- Side panels share the work area's background, and a panel that closes itself unmounts (0ee86f2).
- A quieter minimap and simpler canvas keys (1aa9a72, 9516587).
- Split down stacks the new pane in its column. There are no vertical moves (aecfaa6).
- Whole panes only: tabs at the edges replace the peeks of the continuous canvas (8d837d5, #4).
- An edge rail, resizing on Herdr's own dividers, and gutters instead of lines (#5).
- Kanso leans on the SDK: one panel mod, the header inside the strip, and fewer redraws (#7).
- A README about what Kanso does for you, tests grouped by feature, and a reusable benchmark (#14).
- New screenshots and previews that lead with the strip, the PR handoff, and Open with (cb6540c, 4e16fba, #15, #23).
- README: install optional mods while another layout is shown (#20).

### Fixed

- Drags survive peeks and fillers, and the resize grip is visible (5585ee2).
- The edge rail and dragging in the sidebar (#8).
- Layout writes no longer drop each other, and work that still ran hot was cut (#11).
- Layout writers never save another layout's tree into `kanso.json` (#18, by Iván Campaña).
- The side panel resizes again (#21).
